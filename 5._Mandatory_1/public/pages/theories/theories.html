        <h3>Variable identifiers - <u>var</u> vs <u>const</u> vs <u>let</u></h3>
        <p>
            <code>var</code> - The scope of a var is either a Global Variable when declared outside of a function. 
            but var can also be declared inside a functions scope and both updated and re-declared.
            This can become an issue when you have multiple var's with the same name in the same function scope
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>let</code> - The scope of a let is block scoped which is bound by curly brackets <code>{}</code>.
            A let can be updated however it cannot be redefined.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>const</code> - The scope of a const is block scoped which is bound by curly brackets <code>{}</code>.
            A const cannot be updated nor redefined.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>Hoisting</code> - The useful part of hoisting is when functions are declared after they are called. 
            the variables const and let however wont be initialized with a default value when hoisted to the top, where
            var will be initiallized with undefined.
        </p>

        <h3>Design of a REST API</h3>
        <pre>REST API Memes
HTTP    Endpoints       Description
GET     "/memes"        Gets all memes
GET     "/memes/{id}"   Gets meme by specific ID
POST    "/memes"        Adds a new meme
PUT     "/memes/{id}"   Replaces entire meme object by an id with an entire new meme object
PATCH   "/memes/{id}"   Replaces part of a meme object by an id.
DELETE  "/memes/{id}"   Deletes a meme by an ID</pre>
            The REST API uses Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
        <h3>Node.js</h3>
        <p>
            <code>Node.js</code> is a server side JavaScript runtime environment designed to build network applications 
            by executing JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js uses npm as a package manager 
            which is used to run scripts, publish projects, install packages and much more
        </p>
        <h3>Server Side Rendering</h3>
        <p>
            <code>Server Side Rendering</code> also known as SSR is useful to render full HTML for a page for imporved performance.
            This also helps to avoid CORS-errors with data fetching with client side rendering.
            <b>Useful for: Improved performance, Faster load times & better social sharing</b>
        </p>
        <h3>Clean Code and Code conventions</h3>
        <p>
            <code>Consistency</code> The most fundamental part of Clean code is to establish consitancy.
            using blankspaces in the same way across all code semicolon constant after all lines of code or not using it at all.
